std::vector<bool> is a special case that does not follow the standard container interface.  It's designed for memory efficiency but sacrifices some performance and usability features.  One potential issue is that it doesn't provide iterators that satisfy the standard iterator requirements, leading to incompatibility with algorithms expecting standard iterators.  Another less obvious issue is that it often doesn't work correctly with algorithms that rely on swapping elements (e.g., `std::sort`) due to its specialized implementation.
