This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error related to `std::vector<bool>` in C++.  `std::vector<bool>` is optimized for memory usage but doesn't fully adhere to the standard container interface, leading to incompatibility with algorithms that expect standard iterators.  The example code shows this incompatibility and provides a solution using `std::vector<char>` for better interoperability.
